          Letter Craft is a simple and fun way to create and share your own
          custom letters. You can use Letter Craft to create message templates
          for your emails, cover letters, social media posts, etc.

          <br />
          This application was created under my experience with job searching. While it is imperative to get your information out there with applications, it is also important to make sure that your message is clear and concise. This is where Letter Craft comes in. You can create your own templates and use them to send out your information in a quick and efficient manner.

          View the dashboard to see your saved templates, create new ones, and share them with others. You can also access the instructions on how to use Letter Craft, as well as find contact information for the creator.
          <br />
          <br />
          Happy crafting!
